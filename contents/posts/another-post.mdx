As I mentioned in my last [article](https://dev.to/blitz_cloud/vscode-is-now-everywhere-5g9d), I said that code-server lacks a service to run it in the background or at startup. I build a systemd service to solve this issue.

If you want to have the code-server running n the background just follow this steps:

- Create the systemd service with this command

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/code-server.service
```

- Paste the code below.

```
[Unit]
Description=Code-Server Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
User= yourUser
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/code-server

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Start the service

```bash
sudo service code-server start
```

- Check the status

```bash
sudo service code-server status
```

- Optional enable the process at startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable code-server
```

#### Now you should be able to take you safe development environment on your iPad or on your grandma slow computer,without being afraid that the server will stop.
